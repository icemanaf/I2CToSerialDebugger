# I2C to Serial Bridge and Debugger
Tired of modifying ,compiling and flashing code endlessly trying to test your new I2C device using a microcontroller? I thought it would be much easier if we could have a REPL like interface where we can communicate with the I2C device using a very simple text based API through the serial port. The current example was implemented using a ESP8266 based node MCU which serves as the I2C to serial bridge, communicating as a master to the slave I2C device under test.
